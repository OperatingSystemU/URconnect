PLANS:
*Allow for bidirectional document viewing, for example the ability to view photos, videos, texts ect. from your phone on your laptop
through a GUI and then the ability to view document, photos, videos and music from your laptop on your phone. The means of doing this must 
be decided through the most cost effective terms weather it through onboard storage (cost effective) or cloud based (preferable)
*Bidirectional syncing of everything and ability to view everything and edit everything (with edited versions being updated on both platforms)
*Backup funtionality in app for both phone and laptop
*Similar options with icloud in automatic syncing of catagories that the user can designate
*Cross platform password manager (automatically fill passwords across all platforms)







TODO:
*Create .doc .docx .odt .pdf ect. viewer for Uconnect on Android that can sync and pull documents and photos from the laptop and 
be viewable on the Android phone/tablet
*Quick edit feature for editing documents and saving and syncing them (changes on phone show up on document on laptop and vise versa)
*GUI for viewing content from phone on the laptops such as texts, music, photos, videos ect.
*Android phone ability to sync and downloading of music from laptop and vise versa through same GUI
*Wrap all this functionality into a intuitive and easy to use app for android and laptop
*Decide logistics such as cloud syncing, bluetooth syncing ect. 
*Add backup to cloud funtcionality into app for both phone and Laptops (possibly certain amount GB free and then above that you get charged)
*Password manager creation and integration with mobile browsers
